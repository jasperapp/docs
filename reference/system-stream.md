| System Stream | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Team Stream` | Issues on GitHub where your team mentioned |
| `Watching Stream` | Issues in the repositories you're watching on GitHub |
| `Subscription Issue` | Individually registered issues |

The `Team Stream` allows you to get the teams you belong to on GitHub and handle issues where they are mentioned. When you join a new team, the team will be added automatically.

The `Watching Stream` can retrieve repositories that you have watched on GitHub and handle issues in those repositories. When you watch a new repository, it will automatically add it to your repository.

The `Subscription Stream` provides the ability to handle individually registered issues. Register the URL of the issue from the `Subscription Stream` menu.
