  There are a number of features available in Jasper to help you browse issues
  efficiently. Here are some of the most commonly used features.

# Browse Issues

## Unread issues

To quickly display just the unread issues, use the issue's filter function - select `Filter by unread` from the filters at the top of the issue list. Alternatively, you can also display just the unread issues by pressing `U` on your keyboard.

## Read it later.

If you want to read it later, Jasper offers two ways to return an issue to unread: by selecting `Mark as Unread` from the issue's floating menu. Alternatively, you may choose to mark an issue as unread by pressing `I` on the keyboard while it is selected.

The second way to bookmark an issue is to add it to your bookmarks. Select `Add to Bookmark` from the issue's floating menu. Alternatively, you may bookmark a selected issue by pressing  `B`  on the keyboard.

## Exclude unwanted issues

You can use the archive feature to exclude issues that you do not need to view in the future. To archive, select `Move to Archive` from the floating menu. Alternatively, you may archive an issue in the selected state by pressing the `E` key on your keyboard.

## Check for unread comments.

When viewing an issue in Jasper's built-in browser, Jasper will highlight the comments that have been added or updated since the last time you viewed the issue. You will also see a mini-map of the comments that have been added/updated on the left side of the issue. You can use this comment highlighting and minimap to quickly see which comments have not been read.

{% tab title="Highlight comments" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Comment minimap" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Also, any updates to the body of the issue will be displayed as a differential.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Notice of difference" %}

{% tab title="Show the difference" %}
