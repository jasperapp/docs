# Stream appearance and notifications

## Stream colors and notification settings <a id="color"></a>

Streams can be configured with colors and icons in the detail settings. This allows for grouping and allows you to make important Streams stand out from the crowd.

Notifications can also be turned on or off per Stream. For lesser Streams, you can turn off notifications so you don't miss important notifications.

{% hint style="info" %}
Icons are available for all types of icons registered in [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).
{% endhint %}

## Stream collective settings <a id="disable"></a>

Stream notifications can also be changed in batches from the Jasper-wide configuration screen.

You can also hide unwanted Streams. For example, if you don't use `Inbox` or `Archive`, you can hide them to make Jasper easier to see.
