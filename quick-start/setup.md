## Setting up an access token <a id="github"></a>

When Jasper is launched, you will be presented with a choice of GitHub or GHE \(GitHub Enterprise\), for GHE enter the hostname `example ghe.example.com`.

Next, you will need to enter an access token, which can be created from the [Personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) screen on GitHub or by contacting the GHE administrator for assistance. The required scopes are `repo`, `read:org`, `notifications` and `user`.
