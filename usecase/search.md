# Search issues

## Search from Stream

## Search from All

To search through Jasper's holdings of issues, we use the `Jump Navigation` feature, starting with the 🔍 icon in the top left corner. You can also start by pressing `⌘ + E (Mac)`, `Ctrl + E (Window/Linux)`.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use the same filters as Filter Stream to search in Jump Navigation. See "[Filter Stream](../reference/filter-stream.md)" in the reference section for more information.
{% endhint %}
