# Basic usage

## Stream

After setup, it will automatically create Streams.

| Stream | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Me`   | <p>You can see the issues/pull requests that are relevant to you. Basically, you can look at this stream and you won't miss anything. <br>You will also see issues filtered by <code>My Issues</code>, <code>My PRs</code> and <code>Assign</code>.</p> |
| `Team` | <p>Issues that are maintained by the team you are on.<br>You will also see issues filtered by team.</p>                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Repo` | <p>Issues from the repositories you have recently been active in.<br>You can also see a filtered issues for each repository.</p>                                                                                                                        |

The following operations are particularly useful for viewing issues

| action                       | How to operate                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Show only unread issues      | <p>Select <code>Filter by unread</code> in the filter menu.<br>Or press <code>U</code> on the keyboard.</p> |
| Set the issue back to unread | <p>Click the unread icon on the floating menu.<br>Or press <code>I</code> on the keyboard.</p>              |
