## Setting up an access token <a href="#access-token" id="access-token"></a>

When Jasper is launched, you will be presented with a choice of GitHub or GHE (GitHub Enterprise), for GHE enter the hostname `example ghe.example.com`.

Next, you will need to enter an access token, which differs between GitHub and GHE.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="For GitHub" %}
For GitHub, we recommend setting up an access token using OAuth. Please follow the on-screen instructions to perform OAuth authentication.

Alternatively, an access token can be created and used from a [Personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). The required scopes are `repo`, `read:org`, `notifications`, `user` and `read:project` .
