# Basic usage

## Stream

After setup, it will automatically create Streams.

| Stream | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Me`               | You can see issues/pull requests that are relevant to you. Basically, you won't miss anything if you look at this Stream. You can also filter by `My Issues` or `My PRs`. |
| `My Issues`        | Issue I was creating                                                                                           |
| `My PRs`           | Pull request you created                                                                                    |
| `Assigned`         | Issue/pull request to which you are assigned                                                                         |
| `Review Requested` | Review requested pull request                                                                               |

In addition, the following notice will appear after a while. Follow the instructions to create other streams.
